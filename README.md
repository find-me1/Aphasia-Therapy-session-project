# APHASIA THERAPY SESSION

### Course Project at IIT Palakkad

#### INTRODUCTION

Aphasia is a disorder where you have problem speaking or understanding what other people say. It usually happens
because of the damage to part of your brain but can also happen with conditions that disrupt how your brain works.
There are also multiple types of aphasia. The location of the damage in your brain determines the type of aphasia
you have. This condition is almost always a symptom of another problem, such as a stroke or traumatic brain injury.
It can also happen as a temporary effect of conditions like migraines.

##### Treatment

If the brain damage is mild, it’s possible to recover language skills without treatment. However, most people undergo
speech and language therapy to rehabilitate their language skills and supplement their communication experiences.
Researchers are investigating the use of medications, alone or in combination with speech therapy, to help people
with aphasia.

##### Speech and language rehabilitation

Recovery of language skills is usually a slow process. Although most people make significant progress, few people
regain full pre-injury communication levels.
Speech and language therapy aims to improve the ability to communicate. The therapy helps by restoring as much
language as possible, teaching how to make up for lost language skills and finding other methods of communicating.

##### ABSTRACT

Therapy for aphasia can be made available to people suffering from it in many ways that includes offline sessions that
will be executed by speech therapists . Considering the fact that aphasia is specific to people and the symptoms and
conditions vary from one individual to another, offline therapy is effective but the availability of the therapists and
the curation of correct therapeutic procedures pose a disadvantage here .

A good alternative to this is developing an application that makes people suffering from Aphasia undergo therapy sessions remotely . Developing an app
hosting the therapy for aphasia allows patients to access it with ease with a plethora of exercises curated by speech
pathologists .


##### METHODOLOGY :

##### Therapeutic procedures :

Important task in creating an application for therapy is listing out the tasks that enhance different forms of speech
and communication . This mainly includes listening , speaking , reading and writing of LSRW which form four pillars
of language . Different types of exercises can be curated with the combined effort of therapists and speech pathologists .

Listening :
Listen and choose the picture, 
Listen and choose the word, 
Listen and choose the alphabet.

Writing :
Write the name of picture, 
Write the name of spoken word, 
Write the spoken alphabet.

Speaking :
Name the picture, 
Name the word, 
Name the alphabet.

Reading :
Read the name and select the corresponding picture, 
Match capital and lowercase letters.

### DEVELOPMENT :

A web application is  created using react so that users can directly access the therapy through the website.

### Deployment

The project has been deployed using Netlify. You can access the deployed version here:

use the below link in microsoft edge for a better experience.

### APPLICATION FEATURES :

Welcome page The application opens up to the user with a greeting message.

Different types of exercises various types of exercises in each field of speech and communication i.e listening, writing,
reading,speaking are considered for therapy . Each exercise will have its own datasets that are taken to make users
try different questions.

Speech recognition for speaking exercises Application takes voice response from users in speaking exercise and validates
it against the correct answer. An extent of the user’s inability is taken into consideration while validating the input
so as to conduct the exercise liberally.

Voice support for specific exercises A mic button is created that reads out the test question aloud , which is important
to test the user’s listening skills which at the same time makes the application more interactive.

Day-wise task creation in the web application Data Sets are created in the web application in such a way that the
user can check the number of days he took therapy, which also ensures to keep users consistent.

web application that interacts with patients and sends them reminders to complete their tasks, providing an engaging
and personalized experience.It’s set up to remind them every minute, so they stay on top of what they need to do.

### POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS :

Accuracy of speech recognition can be improved to facilitate above moderate aphasia patients whose speech is rela-
tively more broken .

Data sets for exercises can be expanded with recommendations from the speech pathologists.
Patients can be authenticated at start , so that patients statistics can be stored and used for modifications in treatment
